# API Hostify

A project by EscapedShadows for **everyone** and completely **Free**.

---

API Hostify is an open-source project maintained by EscapedShadows, licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

API Hostify enables anyone to quickly transform any Python-supporting device into a simple JSON API.

There are three versions of API Hostify:

- Bucket
- Bin
- Container

Each version has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Let's explore the versions and understand their differences!

## Bucket

As you might have guessed, Bucket utilizes a common method for storing mass JSON data (slightly modified): with something called "Buckets."

You can imagine it as having a folder with many files named Bucket01.json, Bucket02.json, etc.

It's easy to keep this system organized, but it can be challenging to remember where specific data is stored.

## Bin

Essentially, Bin is a larger version of Bucket that utilizes the original system of Bucket data storage.

Instead of just having files, each bucket is another folder, allowing you to create as many files in one bucket as you want.

This can lead to some confusion and difficulty in finding data (we are working on a system to export all data in the near future).

## Container

Container is not a larger version of Bin but rather a mass storage consisting of **one** single JSON file storing **all** of the data. 

This system is typically used for smaller projects.

## Why did I create this project?

I created this project because I understand the difficulties of writing a simple and clean API, ensuring it works, fixing bugs, handling system implementations, writing documentation, and maintaining the project. Plus, I enjoy providing free resources.

# Future Plans

In the future, I plan to:
- Add a system to export all data of a bucket or the entire API at once.
- Implement configurable backups.
- Improve planning and development based on user feedback.
